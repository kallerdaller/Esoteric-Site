                            <h2>Game Overview</h2>
                            <p class="text-left">The game (currently named Esoteric but highly suseptable to be changed) is a card game that can be easily played by anyone but can be quite difficult to master.&nbsp;<br>It is a two player game in which two towns compete to
                                have the best firework display while being restricted to the same resources. You are able to sabotage the other player and boost your own display. Each town has three stages of their show, each with three oppertunities
                                to let off fireworks or sabotage the other player. Each game lasts around 4-5 minutes.<br>Each card has a pip which represents its value. Each player is given five cards worth values 1-5 and four additional cards worth
                                1 point each but each with their own ability. These abilities are to boost the next card you play by double, swap the current card with what the other places, a card that turns the other players card into a 2 point card
                                with no abilities, and a card which destroys the highest value card of that round.<br>Their is an optional rule which involves the colours of the cards but this is still being polished.<br></p><img class="rounded" src="https://gyazo.com/c6c8a36283eccc9365d23570cedfbd9b.png"

                            <h2>Features</h2>
                            <p>The game, while simplistic, has many enticing features already completed, in the works, or planned.</p>
                            <h3>Completed</h3>

                            <p>Colour blind friendly cards - this is an important feature as we want this game to be accessible by as many people as possible. We will have an option in the settings with different colours and pip shapes for colour blind people.
                                If you are colourblind and would like to give feedback on this when implemented, please send me an email at:&nbsp;<a class="text-body" href="mailto:darley0alex1@gmail.com" target="_blank">darley0alex1@gmail.com</a><br>Graphics

                            <h2>Team Creation</h2>
                            <p>The team consists of I (kaller/Alex) and The_Ecliptican. I am the developer of the game while The_Ecliptican is the designer of the game. He created the whole idea and rules behind the game and has had the idea for around a
                                year, working on it. He originally had the game in Tabletop Simulator however contacted me to make a prototype. Upon completion of the prototype I decided I wanted to carry on full time with the game and take it from start
                                to finish. Eventually The_Ecliptican would like to release a board game version of the game.</p>
                            <h2>Price</h2>
                            <p>It has been decided that the game will be free to play with the option to pay via itch.io. This means that anyone can download the game, connect to the servers and play. Any donations do help to keep the servers up but we do
                                not see the costs of the server being an issue. We had thoughts about making the local play be free and online play cost a few dollars but landed on the idea of the game being completely free to play.</p>
                            <h2>Release Date</h2>
                            <p>The game will release hopefully on the 14th of July 2020 on itch.io. The game is ready to be released but there are a few things we would like to do before then. This includes changing the name, creating promotional art, having
                                accessibility features and additional graphics along with any bugs being ironed out.&nbsp;</p>
